Algebraic geometry aims to exploit the duality between structures in commutative algebra and geometry, combining the technical aspects of the former with the intuition afforded by the latter to provide deeper insight into both fields of study.
Over the past three decades, derived categories have come to play a central role in this study, often by unlocking relationships between varieties that are hidden away from the traditional geometry.

Recent developments in Artin-Zhang style noncommutative algebraic geometry lay the foundation for adapting these methods to the study of noncommutative graded algebras.
My work is focused on further developing the theory of derived categories for these noncommutative projective schemes via the framework of differential graded categories.
