  abstract={We give a noncommutative geometric description of the internal Hom dg-category in the homotopy category of dg-categories between two noncommutative projective schemes in the style of Artin-Zhang. As an immediate application, we give a noncommutative projective derived Morita statement along the lines of Rickard and Orlov.},
