I monitor my email during regular business hours and try to respond within one business day.    Official University Email Addresses  The University provides each student with an email address, username@warhawks.ulm.edu , and all official course correspondence will only be conducted using official university email addresses.    Email Etiquette  When you send an email, your message should contain the following information   Subject  A few words that describe the content of your email along with the course identifier (Math 3040 - 64086).    Salutation  A professional greeting such as Dear or Hello followed by the appropriate honorific and the recipient's last name (  Dr. X).   If the person you are addressing holds a doctorate ( a Ph.D. ), then you should address the recipient as Dr. X, never Mr. X, Ms. X, or Mrs. X.    If you are unsure, Professor X is generally a safe way to address a faculty member.       Body  A concise message that clearly expresses the purpose of your email.    Signature  A simple closing (e.g. Sincerely,  Thank you,  Best regards,  ) followed by your first and last name.   For your convenience, included below is an example email.   Sample Email  Dear Dr. Farman,  I am having trouble with this week's homework. I have tried working through the examples in the text, but I am struggling to understand the concepts involved. Could we schedule a time to meet before the next class to discuss some of the concepts in more detail?  Thank you,  Jane Doe    "

  "body": " Course Information   Course Description  This course provides instruction to abstract algebra and real analysis and is a continuation of MATH 2040.    Course Prerequisites  A grade of C or better in MATH 2040.    Course Objectives  The primary goal of this course is to further develop the ability to read and write mathematical proofs. We will develop proof techniques particular to the mathematical disciplines of analysis and algebra.    Course Topics   This course develops techniques from two extraordinarily disparate mathematical disciplines. While these two disciplines often study related problems, the techniques are cleanly bifurcated.    Analysis  Analysis is a branch of mathematics that focuses on limits and constructions based thereon. Roughly speaking, analytic constructions based on limits are often called continuous .  This courses will focus on selected topics from analysis, roughly equivalent to the first half of MATH 3080 Real Analysis:   Completeness  Supremum  Infimum      Basic Topology of    Open Sets       Closed Sets  Limit Points  Closure     Continuity of Functions   Compactness  Heine-Borel Theorem         Sequences  Convergence  Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem  Bounded Monotone Sequence Theorem           Algebra  Algebra is a branch of mathematics that focuses on structures that arise from equipping a space with one or more finitary operations. Roughly speaking, algebraic structures are generally discrete (the opposite of continuous) in the sense that they do not involve (analytic) limits.  This course will focus on selected topics from algebra, roughly equivalent to the first half of MATH 3086 Modern Algebra:   Algebraic Structures   Binary Operations  Closure  Commutativity  Associativity  Identity  Inverses         Group Theory  Groups  Order  Symmetric Groups  Cyclic Groups  Generators     Subgroups   Structure Preserving Maps  Homomorphisms  Isomorphisms         Ring Theory  Rngs  Rings   Domains  Fields      Structure Preserving Maps  Homomorphisms  Isomorphisms             Instructional Methods  This course is offered as a face-to-face course. Learning will be facilitated through traditional lecture, group work\/activities, homework, and in-class assessments.    Temporary Remote Instruction (TRI)  During the semester, class and\/or campus operations might be disrupted by an occurrence such as a tornado, fire, or illness outbreak that temporarily prevents in-person instruction. Until in-person instruction is possible, the class will enter a phase of temporary remote instruction (TRI). During this phase, instruction will take place via virtual means, either synchronously or asynchronously. Your instructor will alert you when this happens via e-mail and will include a description of how the course will proceed.  During a period of temporary remote instruction, the need for the course to continue in a virtual manner means that you will be required to have appropriate equipment, software, and telecommunication access to allow you to participate.   Technical Requirements During TRI     A stable internet connection that is capable of joining Zoom meetings and taking assessments.    A web camera (internal or external) and a microphone that can be used for Zoom meetings.       "

  "body": " Course Policies and Procedures   At a minimum, all policies stated in the current ULM student policy manual & organizational handbook should be followed (see ). Additional class policies follow.    Textbook   Required Textbook   A Transition to Advanced Mathematics, Edition, ISBN: 9781285463261              Attendance Policy  Students are expected to adhere to the Class Attendance Policy outlined in the ULM Student Policy Manual.   Class attendance is regarded as an obligation and a privilege, and all students are expected to attend all required classes in which they are enrolled regularly and punctually. Failure to do so may jeopardize a student’s scholastic standing and may lead to suspension from the University. Students are responsible for the effect absences have on all forms of evaluating course performance.     In accordance with University policy, the instructor will take roll regularly. It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that his\/her attendance is recorded.    Each student is solely responsible for all class material and assignments whether or not the student is present.    A student accumulating absences of 25% of the class meetings regardless of the reasons (excused or unexcused) will be reported to the Dean of Arts, Education, & Sciences which could result in academic withdrawal from the course or a course grade of F.   This may be avoided if the course is dropped; however, it is the responsibility of the student to drop the course.    Class removal carries with it the penalties of being assigned a grade of W or F, whichever is appropriate, and no credit for the course.    Academic withdrawal may negatively impact a student’s full-time status.       University Excuses: Any University-related activity requiring an absence from class will count as an absence when determining if a student has met the minimum attendance requirement.    Only students registered in MATH 3040 may attend the lectures.    Only students registered in mathematics courses may enter the Math Resource Center (MRC).       Late Policy  Late work will not be accepted. Students who cannot submit work due to a University-related activity requiring an absence from class must arrange for work to be submitted before leaving.    Make-up Policy  In the event of one missed exam due to absence, the Final Exam can be used to replace the missing exam. Further missed exams will result in a grade of zero. If a University sponsored activity requires you to miss an exam, you must complete the exam in advance.    Academic Integrity  Faculty and students must observe the ULM published policy on Academic Dishonesty. See the ULM Student Handbook    Any student caught turning in work that is not his\/her own will be reported to the School of Sciences. If the student is found to be responsible for such a violation, then a formal report will be made to the Office of Student Services and the student will receive a grade of F for the course .    Course Evaluation Policy  At a minimum, students are expected to complete the online course evaluation using the Online Course Evaluation system .   "
