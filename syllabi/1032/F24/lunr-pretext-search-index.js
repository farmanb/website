I monitor my email during regular business hours and try to respond within one business day.    Official University Email Addresses  The University provides each student with an email address, username@warhawks.ulm.edu , and all official course correspondence will only be conducted using official university email addresses.    Email Etiquette  When you send an email, your message should contain the following information   Subject    Salutation  A professional greeting such as Dear or Hello followed by the appropriate honorific and the recipient's last name (  Dr. X).   If the person you are addressing holds a doctorate ( a Ph.D. ), then you should address the recipient as Dr. X, never Mr. X, Ms. X, or Mrs. X.    If you are unsure, Professor X is generally a safe way to address a faculty member.       Body  A concise message that clearly expresses the purpose of your email.    Signature  A simple closing (e.g. Sincerely,  Thank you,  Best regards,  ) followed by your first and last name.   For your convenience, included below is an example email.   Sample Email  Dear Dr. Farman,  I am having trouble with this week's homework. I have tried working through the examples in the text, but I am struggling to understand the concepts involved. Could we schedule a time to meet before the next class to discuss some of the concepts in more detail?  Thank you,  Jane Doe    "

Temporary Remote Instruction (TRI)  During the semester, class and\/or campus operations might be disrupted by an occurrence such as a tornado, fire, or illness outbreak that temporarily prevents in-person instruction. Until in-person instruction is possible, the class will enter a phase of temporary remote instruction (TRI). During this phase, instruction will take place via virtual means, either synchronously or asynchronously. Your instructor will alert you when this happens via e-mail and will include a description of how the course will proceed.  During a period of temporary remote instruction, the need for the course to continue in a virtual manner means that you will be required to have appropriate equipment, software, and telecommunication access to allow you to participate.   Technical Requirements During TRI     A stable internet connection that is capable of joining Zoom meetings and taking assessments.    A web camera (internal or external) and a microphone that can be used for Zoom meetings.       "

  "body": " Evaluation   This course will use Mastery Based Grading . The content is broken into standards that you are expected to master by the end of the course.  This grading system is iterative in the sense that you will have multiple opportunities to display mastery of each standard, and forgetful in the sense that your previous unsuccessful attempts are discarded once you demonstrate mastery of a standard.  A description of each standard can be found in .    Assessments  This course will have in-class, written assessments. You may not use the text, your notes, or any devices except a scientific calculator.  Each assessment will contain problems corresponding to one or more standards. The standards are graded independently and, unlike quizzes or tests that you may have had in the past, there is no partial credit. To master a standard, you must master all of the problems that go with the standard.   Reassessment  There are scheduled Reassessment days for this course (see the ) where you will be given problems for every standard that you have not yet mastered . You may attempt as many as time allows.     Homework  Homework will be assigned regularly. The problems are chosen to highlight the core concepts from the standards. Mastery of these homework sets serves as a good indicator for performance on assessments. As such, you should ensure that you fully understand the material on these homework sets; that is, upon completion of the homework set, you should be capable of completing similar problems without the aid of the text, a computer, or any other tools not available during an exam.    Scoring  Written work in this course will be scored on the following scale.   Scale     Mastery (M)  The given solution is correct with no content related errors. Appropriate justification is provided in a clear, easy to follow manner.    Progressing (P)  The given solution demonstrates an understanding of the material, but contains content related errors or lacks justification.    Needs Improvement (N)  The given solution was blank, illegible, or used inappropriate techniques.                  Grading Scale  Letter grades will be assigned based on the number of standards mastered in the course, as specified in the table below.

  "body": " Course Policies and Procedures   At a minimum, all policies stated in the current ULM student policy manual & organizational handbook should be followed (see ). Additional class policies follow.    Textbook   Required Textbook   Calculus Early Transcendentals, edition by Briggs et al, ISBN: 9780138118518   You may purchase access through the ULM Bookstore or directly from Pearson.             Attendance Policy  Students are expected to adhere to the Class Attendance Policy outlined in the ULM Student Policy Manual.   Class attendance is regarded as an obligation and a privilege, and all students are expected to attend all required classes in which they are enrolled regularly and punctually. Failure to do so may jeopardize a student’s scholastic standing and may lead to suspension from the University. Students are responsible for the effect absences have on all forms of evaluating course performance.     In accordance with University policy, the instructor will take roll regularly. It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that his\/her attendance is recorded.    Each student is solely responsible for all class material and assignments whether or not the student is present.    A student accumulating absences of 25% of the class meetings regardless of the reasons (excused or unexcused) will be reported to the Dean of Arts, Education, & Sciences which could result in academic withdrawal from the course or a course grade of F.   This may be avoided if the course is dropped; however, it is the responsibility of the student to drop the course.    Class removal carries with it the penalties of being assigned a grade of W or F, whichever is appropriate, and no credit for the course.    Academic withdrawal may negatively impact a student’s full-time status.       University Excuses: Any University-related activity requiring an absence from class will count as an absence when determining if a student has met the minimum attendance requirement.      Only students registered in mathematics courses may enter the Math Resource Center (MRC).       Late Policy  Late work will not be accepted. Students who cannot submit work due to a University-related activity requiring an absence from class must arrange for work to be submitted before leaving.    Make-up Policy  In the event of a missed assessment due to absence, students will be given the opportunity to attempt all missed standards on the next reassessment. The date and time of the final reassessment are determined by the registrar and cannot be made up.    Academic Integrity  Faculty and students must observe the ULM published policy on Academic Dishonesty. See the ULM Student Handbook    Any student caught turning in work that is not his\/her own will be reported to the School of Sciences. If the student is found to be responsible for such a violation, then a formal report will be made to the Office of Student Services and the student will receive a grade of F for the course .    Course Evaluation Policy  At a minimum, students are expected to complete the online course evaluation using the Online Course Evaluation system .   "
